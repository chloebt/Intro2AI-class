### Audience & Registration
These classes, provided by [ANITI](https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr/en/), are intended for a M2 audience with no specific background in Computer Science or Maths (e.g. Neuro, Bio, Medical, etc.). The classes will be in English, and there will be a mixture of lectures and practical work (TP). For the practical parts, prior experience with Python programming will be required. If you need a refresher on the basics of Python programming before starting our class, you can try [this course] or [this one].

Priority is given to M2 students from Universite de Toulouse. The classes may be open to other interested participants from ANITI or outside, based on availability. 

To pre-register for the class, **it is mandatory to sign up** with the following form:
